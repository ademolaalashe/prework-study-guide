        <h2>JavaScript</h2>

        <ul>



          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>To declare a variable, we use the var keyword. After the var keyword, we give the variable a name.</li>
          <li>We use an assignment operator = to assign the specific data that we want stored in our variable.</li>
          <li>Note that the string is contained within quotation marks, ".</li>
          <li>All strings are surrounded by quotation marks.</li>
          <li>Note that each line of JavaScript code ends with a semicolon.</li>
          <li>The console.log method was created to make it easier for developers to test their code.</li>
          <li>The word console refers to a test environment that developers use to check out their code.</li>
          <li>The second part, .log(), is a method, which means a set of instructions that can be executed by a computer.</li>
          <li>The .log() method will output whatever we add inside the parentheses to the console.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>In JavaScript, code runs from the first statement at the top of the page, down to the last statement at the bottom of the page.</li>
          <li>We can use conditional statements and loops to control the order in which code is executed, or if it is even executed at all.</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data.</li>
          <li>Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.</li>
          <li>To comment out multiple lines of JavaScript code, put /* before and */ after the block of code.</li>
          <li>A function is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
          <li>To create a function, we use the function keyword to declare a new variable.</li>
          <li>A function's name is followed by parentheses ().</li>
